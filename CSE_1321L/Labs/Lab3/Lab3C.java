Lab3C: Coins. We are going to design a program that determines the values of coins in a jar. The program will
prompt the user to enter the number coins (i.e. quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). It will then print out the
number of coins entered for each coin type on separate lines and calculates the total amount of money in the
jar. An example run is shown below. The user input is in bold.
////////////////////
Sample run 1:
Enter the number of quarters: 2  //input
Enter the number of dimes: 2    //input
Enter the number of nickels: 2  //input
Enter the number of pennies: 2  //input
You entered 2 quarters.
You entered 2 dimes.
You entered 2 nickels.
You entered 2 pennies.
Your total is 0 dollars and 82 cents.
////////////////////
Sample run 2:
Enter the number of quarters: 2
Enter the number of dimes: 3
Enter the number of nickels: 4
Enter the number of pennies: 5
You entered 2 quarters.
You entered 3 dimes.
You entered 4 nickels.
You entered 5 pennies.
Your total is 1 dollars and 5 cents.
