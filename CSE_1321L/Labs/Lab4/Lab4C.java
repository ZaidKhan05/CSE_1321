Lab4C: Creating a menu
For this lab exercise you are going to create a basic program which will allow the user to make a selection from
a menu; selecting a different option from the menu should result in a different outcome.
For this lab, please use a switch statement for all possible options the user may input.
First, welcome the user with the welcome message (present in the sample runs below) that explains what the
program does and what the user is expected to do. Next have the user input a number; based on the number
inputted one of the various transformations must be performed.
If the user chooses to exit the program, display “Thank you, goodbye!”. If the user inputs attempts to
input a number that is not on the menu, display “Invalid input, please try again!”
Hints:
• Additive inverse of 5 is -5
• Reciprocal of 3 is 1/3
• There are some math functions to help with exponents (X2 and X3
) however, you don’t need to use them
for this lab.
Remember, the class name should be Lab4C.
