Lab8B: N by N
Create a simple program that asks the user for a row and column size for a 2-D integer array, then have
The program create such an array. At this point this array’s cells should be filled with zeros since
nothing has been done to change the cell values.
Next, have that program dynamically adapt to the sizes of the array (that were provided by the user) and
fill the array with numbers ascending from 1 → n (n being the number of the nth cell in that 2-D Array
depending on the size). Please then print the array out. Remember, you cannot just print an array
out, you have to use loops and print each cell individually.
Please refer to the sample output below for visualization and match its style.
As always:
• Remember, the class name should be Lab8B.
• The user input is indicated in bold.
