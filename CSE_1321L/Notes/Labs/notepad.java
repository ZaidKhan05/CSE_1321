/*
 * Lab5C: What’s the point?
For this lab exercise, you will need to create a program that determines the location of a point on
the Cartesian plane. The program should take the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a point in a
Cartesian plane as input. The inputs should be integer values.
The program should then print out the entered values and the location of the point on the
Cartesian plane.
The possible locations for the point (the outcomes) are:
• On the origin (0, 0)
• On the x-axis
• On the y-axis
• In the first quadrant
• In the second quadrant
• In the third quadrant
• In the fourth quadrant
Example of a Cartesian plane
 Remember, the class name should be Lab5C.
Please follow the example of the sample run is shown below. User input is in bold.

Sample output #1:
Enter x: 0
Enter y: 0
This point is the origin.
Sample output #2:
Enter x: 0
Enter y: 4
This point is on the y axis.
Sample output #3:
Enter x: -5
Enter y: 0
This point is on the x axis.

Sample output #4:
Enter x: 1
Enter y: 1
This point is in the first quadrant.

Sample output #5:
Enter x: -1
Enter y: -1
This point is in the third quadrant.
